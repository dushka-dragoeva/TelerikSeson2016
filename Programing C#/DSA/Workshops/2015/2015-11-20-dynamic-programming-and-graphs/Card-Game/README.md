# Card game

## Description

A natural number is written on each one of **N** cards. Each of the numbers is less than 1000. The cards are arranged next to one another. Martin has invented a new game. On each step of the game one card is removed (not the first, or last one). You get points for each removed card - the product of its number and the sum of its neighbours. In the end there will be two cards left. Write a program wich finds the maximum amount of points which you can get for the given game.

## Input
* Input is read from the console
  * On the first line there is a natural number **N**
  * On the second line there are **N** numbers - the numbers on the cards

## Output
* Output should be printed to the console
  * The maximum amount of points which you can get

## Constraints
* 3 <= **N** <= 700
* Time limit: **0.5 seconds**
* Memory limit: **16 MB**
