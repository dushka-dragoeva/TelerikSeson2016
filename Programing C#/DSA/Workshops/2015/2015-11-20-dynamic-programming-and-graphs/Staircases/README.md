Your task is to write a program that reads the number **N** and writes the only number **Q** â€” amount of different staircases that can be built from exactly **N** bricks.

## Input
* Input is read from the console
  * Natural number **N**

## Output
* Output should be printed to the console
  * Natural number **Q** on a single line

## Constraints
* 5 <= **N** <= 500
* Time limit: **0.2 seconds**
* Memory limit: **64 MB**
