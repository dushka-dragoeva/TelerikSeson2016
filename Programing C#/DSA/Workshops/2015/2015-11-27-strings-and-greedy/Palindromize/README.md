# Palindromize

## Description
A *palindrome* is a string that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

Given a string `s`, return the shortest palindrome that can be produced by adding zero or more characters to the right end of `s`.

There is always one unique answer.

## Input

* Each character of `s` will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
* Time limit: **0.1 seconds**
* Memory limit: **16 MB**
