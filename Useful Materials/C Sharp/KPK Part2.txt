**Defensive Programing

Debug.Asert is using only for private methods
It is not compiled in production
Application crashes if error is not handled
It is ised for preconditions
It is bad practice to use for podt conditions


Try
Catch => we can have some catches in orther to catch 
differnt types Exceptions
In catch we display friendly message
finaly => code that is executed always, like
close db connection, file
open log file
