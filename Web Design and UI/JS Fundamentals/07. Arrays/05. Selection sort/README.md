### Problem 5. Selection sort
*	Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
*	Write a script to sort an array.
*	Use the [selection sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

_Hint: Use a second array_
