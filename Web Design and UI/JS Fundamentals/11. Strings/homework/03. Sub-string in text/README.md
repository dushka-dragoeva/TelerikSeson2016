### Problem 3. Sub-string in text
*	Write a JavaScript function that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
		
_Example:_

The target sub-string is `in`

The text is as follows:
We are liv**in**g **in** an yellow submar**in**e. We don't have anyth**in**g else. **in**side the submar**in**e is very tight. So we are dr**in**k**in**g all the day. We will move out of it **in** 5 days.

The result is: `9`
