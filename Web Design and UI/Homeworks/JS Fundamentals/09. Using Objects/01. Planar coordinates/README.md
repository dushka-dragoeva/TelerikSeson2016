### Problem 1. Planar coordinates
*	Write functions for working with shapes in standard Planar 
coordinate system.
	*	**Points** are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
	*	**Lines** are represented by two points, marking their 
	beginning and ending L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))
*	Calculate the distance between two points.
*	Check if three segment lines can form a triangle.
